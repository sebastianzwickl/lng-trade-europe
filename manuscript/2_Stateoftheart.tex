\section{Literature survey and own contribution}\label{stateoftheart}
In the scope of this paper, plenty of literature might be relevant to provide background information. We restrict ourselves therefore to three sorts of literature without claiming completeness in each of them. We start the literature survey with an overview of the heat sector in Norway, encompassing a rough description of the current situation and particularly its future development until 2060. After that, we comprehensively examine on concepts of modeling district heating in large-scale energy system models. Thereby, we also take up literature focusing on general challenges in modeling the energy systems. We conclude this section with selected studies that examine the economic viability and profitability of district heating systems. Finally, our own contribution concludes this section and presents this work's novelties.

%
%This paper presents a novel and integrated model framework to analyze coupled heat and power sectors. Said framework is designed to assess large-scale/multi-national systems such as the European continent’s one. The integral model character derives from a model sequence that first models heat demand at individual district heating network level, then determines the heat supply schedules of individual heat generation units in these networks and finally uses an extended version of a pre-existing large-scale market model, the WILMAR Joint Market Model, for electricity market simulations \cite{felten2020integrated}
%
%The question is therefore whether district heating can contribute to ensuring the sustainability of future energy systems? Denmark is used as a case as the country has a high share of district heating and produces 20\% of the electricity with wind power. The analyses are carried out using the electricity market model Balmorel (international perspective) \cite{munster2012role}
%

%there is also a general trend towards more flexible models \cite{lopion2018review}
%
%District heating is seen as an important concept to decarbonize heating systems and meet climate mitigation goals. However, the decision related to where central heating is most viable is dependent on many different aspects, like heating densities or current heating structures. An urban energy simulation platform based on 3D building objects can improve the accuracy of energy demand calculation on building level, but lacks a system perspective. Energy system models help to find economically optimal solutions for entire energy systems, including the optimal amount of centrally supplied heat, but do not usually provide information on building level. Coupling both methods through a novel heating grid disaggregation algorithm, we propose a framework that does three things simultaneously: optimize energy systems that can comprise all demand sectors as well as sector coupling, assess the role of centralized heating in such optimized energy systems, and determine the layouts of supplying district heating grids with a spatial resolution on the street level \cite{steingrube2021method}

%\subsection{the profitability of district heating systems}

%
%This is mainly due to the combined utilization of the storage in a seasonal approach to shift the waste heat from summer to the winter period and as a short term buffer. Thus, the profits from actively participating on the electricity market with the existing combined heat and power (CHP) plants are increased. \cite{kofinger2018simulation}
%
%The study also suggests that CO2-emissions, fuel consumption and socio-economic costs can be reduced by expanding district heating \cite{moller2010conversion}
%
%Individual heat pumps seem to be the best alternative to district heating. In the short term, heat pumps are to be found at the same level as district heating in terms of fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions and cost. The cost is a little higher close to the district heating system but a little lower in houses further away. In the long-term perspective, in a 100 per cent renewable energy system, the fuel efficiency is high and, with regard to cost, the solution is more or less equal to district heating. However, it is highly dependent on the distance to existing district heating grids \cite{lund2010role}

%%\subsection{Progress beyond state-of-the-art}\label{novelties}
%%Based on the literature review, the scientific contribution and novelties of this paper can be summarized as follows:
%%\begin{itemize}
%%	\item An equitable and socially balanced change of a currently gas-based heating system toward a sustainable alternative in a rented multi-apartment old building is modeled considering the complex ownership structure and relations between the property owner and tenants to "take action".
%%	\item Since the governance's first and foremost aim is \replaced{that}{for} the heat system exchange in the multi-apartment building takes place, it is shown \deleted{in }how the governance incentivizes the sustainable investment through monetary and regulative support for both the property owner and tenants. While respecting the property owner's and tenants' individual financial interests, the governance's optimal financial support strategy puts particular emphasis on the highly efficient provision of the residential heat service needs, heat demand reduction, and building efficiency improvements.
%%	\item The developed analytical framework determines a cost-optimal and socially balanced governance’s subsidization strategy for the decarbonization of the heat demand at the building level. That includes, among others, the profit-oriented behavior of the property owner and the tenants, as well as the abovementioned financial support parity among both sides.  Especially, the proposed optimization model allows detailed quantitative analyses of justice in low-carbon residential buildings and the heating sector with an eye on the complex ownership structure within buildings. Moreover, this work focuses on the economic trade-offs between different agents in the energy transition, particularly the government’s role in triggering private investments and social balance with an eye on the costs of inaction (opportunity costs) and increasing carbon prices.	
%%	\item Different sensitivity analyses play a key role in this paper, understanding that the impact of varying allocations of the costs of inaction among the governance, the property owner, and the tenants can be seen as one of the main novelties of this work. Moreover, the importance of building stock renovation in the context of public monetary payments is critically discussed. Insights in that respect can help build a more reliable understanding of a sustainable future urban society predominantely living in highly efficient rental apartments.
